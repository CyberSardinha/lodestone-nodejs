## Helping out

Helping to build this API is very simple, basic Javascript/JQuery knowledge is all you need for parsing, and some MySQL understanding will help in the persistent areas (not required)

If you are interested, check out:
- [Getting A Local Environment Setup](SETUP.md)
- [Contributing to the API](CONTRIBUTE.md) (Once you've parsed a page)
